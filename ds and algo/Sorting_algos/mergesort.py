'''MergeSort
MergeSort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides a list into
 equal halves until it has two single elements and then merges 
 the sub-lists until the entire list has been reassembled in order.'''


'''Divide
Our MergeSort code will focus first on the divide portion of the 
algorithm. If the list we receive has only a single element in it,
 the list can be considered sorted and we can return immediately.
  This is our recursion base case. If we have more than 1 element 
  we need to split the list into equal halves and call MergeSort 
  again for each half.

Conquer
Once you have split the list down to single elements, your mergesort
 will start merging lists, in order, until you have reassembled the
  entire list in order.'''
